Overview and goals 🧭
Daily Autoswap Plume aims to make it simple to run a daily swap routine against the Plume Portal. The bot handles price checks, timing windows, liquidity checks, and transaction submission. It is designed to minimize risk while maximizing predictability in routine operations.

The project is built to be deterministic. If you provide the same input conditions, the bot should produce the same decisions. The codebase favors explicit logic and small, testable units. This makes it easier to verify behavior, reproduce issues, and audit decision points.

This README explains how the bot is structured, how to set it up, and how to operate it in a safe and predictable way. It also covers extending the bot with new strategies, integrating additional data sources, and keeping the system healthy over time.

Why this project exists and who should use it 👥
- Traders who want to automate daily swaps on Ambient DEX via the Plume Portal.
- Dev teams looking for a clean reference implementation of a swap automation bot with a Plume Portal integration.
- Hobbyists who want to learn how to structure a robust automation bot with clear separation of concerns.

The bot is designed so you can operate with confidence in production. It includes safety rails such as rate limiting, retry policies, and explicit error handling. It also emphasizes observability so you can monitor behavior, diagnose issues, and adjust strategies as needed.

Key features and capabilities ✨
- Daily swap routines: Schedule swaps across defined time windows to optimize liquidity and pricing.
- Plume Portal integration: Adapter layer abstracts the Portal calls, enabling clean separation from swap logic.
- Decision strategies: Pluggable strategies decide when to initiate a swap based on price data, liquidity, and time constraints.
- Safe buy/sell checks: Pre-checks ensure there is sufficient liquidity and acceptable slippage before submission.
- Transaction lifecycle handling: Build, sign, submit, and confirm swaps with robust retry logic.
- Observability: Structured logs and metrics for monitoring performance and diagnosis.
- Configurability: Rich configuration options for wallets, networks, and strategies.
- Extensibility: Easy to add new adapters, markets, or strategies without touching core code.

How it works at a high level 🧩
- A scheduler triggers the bot according to a daily plan.
- The core engine queries data via adapters connected to Plume Portal endpoints.
- Strategies evaluate the current market conditions and time constraints to decide whether to act.
- When a decision is made, the core engine builds a transaction, signs it, and submits it to the relevant network.
- The system records the outcome, updates state, and proceeds to the next scheduled window.

Configuration examples and how to tailor behavior to your needs 🧭
You should have a configuration file that defines your wallet, target markets, trading rules, and scheduling. Below is a representative example to illustrate the structure. Do not copy exactly; adapt to your environment and security requirements.

config.yaml (example)
plume_portal:
  base_url: "https://plume-portal.example.org"
  api_key: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY"
  timeout_ms: 15000

network:
  name: "mainnet"
  rpc_url: "https://rpc.mainnet.example.org"
  chain_id: 1

wallet:
  type: "ledger"  # or "mnemonic" or "privateKey"
  auth:
    mnemonic: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_12_WORD_MNEMONIC"
    derivation_path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0"

trading:
  schedule:
    daily_windows:
      - start: "06:00"
        end: "08:00"
      - start: "18:00"
        end: "22:00"
  price_constraints:
    max_slippage_pct: 0.5
    min_liquidity_eth: 10
  risk_controls:
    max_consecutive_failures: 3
    max_active_swaps: 1

strategies:
  default:
    name: "price-then-liquidity"
    params:
      target_pair: "PLUME-ETH"
      price_source: "oracleV2"
      liquidity_source: "plume"
      retry_on_failure: true

logging:
  level: "info"
  to_file: true
  file_path: "./logs/bot.log"
  format: "json"

observability:
  enable_metrics: true
  metrics_endpoint: "http://localhost:9090/metrics"

This example shows organization and naming conventions you can adopt. Your real config should use strong, unique values and secure handling of credentials.

How to customize strategies and extend functionality 🧠
- Core idea: Keep decision logic separate from the data access layer. The adapters should handle all external communication, while strategies decide what to do with the data.
- Create a new strategy by implementing the Strategy interface in the strategies/ directory. The interface defines a method like decide(context) -> Decision, where Decision is a small data structure describing the action to take (or none).
- Add a new adapter for a different Portal or exchange by implementing the Adapter interface. This keeps the data access isolated and makes it easy to swap in new data sources.
- Tests should cover both the data layer (adapters) and the decision layer (strategies). Each test should be deterministic and fast so you can run them frequently.

A sample design sketch
- Core Engine: Orchestrates the schedule and executes decisions from strategies.
- Adapters: Fetch market data, liquidity, and pricing from Plume Portal.
- Strategy Layer: Encapsulates the logic for when to swap based on time windows, price, and liquidity.
- Wallet Layer: Manages signing and submission of transactions securely.
- Validator Layer: Checks each action before submitting to ensure it meets safety criteria.
- Logger and Metrics: Collect meaningful data about decisions, actions, and outcomes.

Security, privacy, and integrity considerations 🔒
- Use secure storage for credentials. If possible, rely on hardware wallets or secure keystores instead of plaintext files.
- Regularly rotate API keys and signing keys. Do not hard-code credentials in the repository or configuration files.
- Validate inputs from external sources. Treat all external data as potentially unreliable and implement strict checks.
- Log only what is necessary for debugging and support. Avoid logging secrets in plain text.
- Use deterministic builds and verify release artifacts with checksums when provided by the project maintainers.

Observability, logs, and troubleshooting 🧭
- Logs should include timestamp, log level, component, and a concise message.
- Important events to log: data fetch success/failure, decision points, trade outcomes, errors, retries, and time window transitions.
- Metrics can include swap success rate, average time to execute, latency to Plume Portal, and queue depth for pending actions.
- When something goes wrong, use the logs to trace the sequence of events. The goal is to reproduce the exact scenario in a test environment.

Testing strategy and quality practices 🧪
- Unit tests cover small, deterministic functions in adapters and strategies.
- Integration tests exercise end-to-end flows with mocked Plume Portal responses.
- Property-based tests validate that decisions stay within defined constraints for a wide range of inputs.
- Use CI to ensure tests run on every pull request and to verify compatibility across supported environments.

Release management and artifact handling 📦
- The Releases page hosts build artifacts for different platforms. You can download the release asset that matches your platform.
- The release assets are intended to be portable and self-contained. They include the core engine, strategies, and a minimal runtime if needed.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Update the changelog with a concise description of changes.

What to expect in a typical day with Daily Autoswap Plume 🗓️
- The bot wakes up at the configured start of the first daily window.
- It fetches price data and liquidity metrics.
- It evaluates risk and decides whether to initiate a swap.
- If a decision is made, it prepares a transaction, ensures it is safely signed, and submits it to the network.
- It logs the result and prepares for the next window or completes the run if all windows pass.
- Throughout the day, it provides observability data so you can monitor its activity in real time or review trends later.

Running in production and operational practices 🏗️
- Use a process manager (like PM2 or systemd) to keep the bot running and to restart it on failures.
- Run the bot in a dedicated environment with limited network exposure to reduce risk surface.
- Use a centralized logging and metrics system to observe activity and diagnose issues quickly.
- Maintain a clean separation between configuration and code. Store credentials in a secure vault or environment, not in the repository.

Deploying updates and maintaining reliability 📈
- Tag releases clearly in version control and write release notes describing the changes and impact.
- Before deploying a new release, run the test suite and perform a dry-run if possible to validate behavior.
- After deployment, monitor logs and metrics to confirm that the new version behaves as expected.

Code quality and contribution workflow 🤝
- Follow a consistent coding style. Use the project’s lint and formatting rules.
- Keep functions small and well-documented. Each module should have a clear single responsibility.
- Write tests for new features and for any behavior that could affect risk or performance.
- Document new configuration options and usage patterns in the README and in docs.

Contributing guidelines and community norms 🧭
- Open issues for bugs, feature requests, and improvements. Be explicit about the problem, the desired outcome, and any steps to reproduce.
- Propose changes via a pull request with a clear title and description. Include references to related issues and test results.
- Keep discussions constructive and focused on the code and its behavior. Encourage reviews and feedback.
- Respect the licensing terms and license the contributions accordingly.

Sample usage scenarios and demonstrations 🎬
- Scenario 1: Daily liquidity check with a single window. The bot uses the default strategy to check price and liquidity at 06:00 UTC, and executes if conditions are met.
- Scenario 2: Two-window day with safety margins. The bot checks liquidity at 06:00 UTC, then again at 18:00 UTC, ensuring slippage stays within the defined tolerance.
- Scenario 3: Unexpected market movement. The bot detects a sudden price shift and cancels planned actions while providing a detailed log for review.

Troubleshooting common issues (structure rather than warnings) 🧰
- If the bot fails to fetch portal data, check network access, API keys, and portal base URL. Verify the endpoint is reachable and that the credentials are valid.
- If a swap is not executed as expected, review the decision log to confirm conditions, and check the transaction submission path for signatures and gas estimates.
- If logs show repeated retries, examine the retry policy and ensure there is sufficient liquidity and funds to complete the swap.
- If the process restarts unexpectedly, check system resources and verify that the process manager is configured correctly.

Data integrity and reproducibility 🧬
- The bot’s behavior should be repeatable given the same inputs and configuration. Store configuration as code or as a versioned artifact.
- Do not rely on ephemeral environment state. Use stable data sources with clear versioning where possible.
- When diagnosing issues, reproduce the exact scenario with the same inputs in a controlled test environment.
